# c_projects
These are the projects I have done in C programming language
The 'small' directory contains the files/directories of the small projects I have done using the C programming language
The 'medium' directory on the other hand contains the files/directories of the projects I have done using C programming language that I consider to be medium, not soo complex and also not soo easy
Lastly, the 'big' directory contains the files/directories of the projects I have done in C programming that I consider to be advanced and complex.
